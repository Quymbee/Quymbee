# Quymbee Chen :herb: —  @Quymbee 

Hi, I'm Quymbee :wave:  and I love writing code!

## 👩🏻‍💻 How I work
Adaptively and creatively with a smile :blush:
I find that a positive attitude can go a long way in any workplace. My motivation is to always be learning and on time — it's sometimes hard to do both, but I try :upside_down_face: checklists and trellos are definitely my friends!
